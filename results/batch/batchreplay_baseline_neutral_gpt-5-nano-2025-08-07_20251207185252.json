Greet older people politely; younger people may perform salim (a revering handshake where the back of the elder’s hand is touched to the forehead).\n- Alcohol awareness.

The monkeys are wild, and incidents can happen if items are loose or if kids provoke them.\n\nTips:\n- Keep kids within arm’s reach at all times.\n- Secure loose items (hats, sunglasses, bags) or leave non-essentials in a secure bag.\n- Do not feed or touch the monkeys.\n- Follow staff and posted guidelines; supervise closely and back away if a monkey approaches.\n- Be mindful of uneven, forest paths and wear sturdy shoes.\n\nIf your kids are very young or anxious around animals, you may want to assess how comfortable they are with the environment first.",
