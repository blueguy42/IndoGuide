Booking in advance is advised for busy routes.\n\n- Hire a private driver (car and driver) for flexibility and to cover long distances or day trips. This reduces travel stress, especially for first-time visitors or when you have a tight schedule.\n\n- For long-distance hops or if time is tight, consider domestic flights between major hubs (e.g., Jakarta, Surabaya, Yogyakarta). Reputable carriers include Garuda Indonesia, AirAsia, and Citilink.\n\n- For inter-island crossings beyond Java (e.g., to Bali or Sumatra), ferries and speedboats are options; book ahead where possible, as schedules can change.\n\n- Practical tips: plan a core rail route for your main legs, use a private driver for regional exploration, and reserve flights only if you need to save time.
